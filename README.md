This repository contains the interactive dashboard on "Sales Insights" 

The project aims to develop a comprehensive loan management system with a focus on monitoring key performance indicators (KPIs) related to loan applications, funded amounts, amount received, average interest rates, and debt-to-income ratios. The system will include various data visualization tools such as charts and grids to provide insights into lending trends, regional analysis, loan term distribution, borrower employment lengths, loan purposes, and home ownership impact.

**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) Requirements:**

1)Total Loan Applications: Tracking the total number of loan applications received during a specified period, including Month-to-Date (MTD) and Month-over-Month (MoM) changes.

2)Total Funded Amount: Understanding the total amount of funds disbursed as loans, with MTD and MoM analysis.

3)Total Amount Received: Monitoring the total amount received from borrowers, analyzing MTD and MoM changes.

4)Average Interest Rate: Calculating the average interest rate across all loans, MTD, and monitoring MoM variations.

5)Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI): Evaluating the average DTI for borrowers, including MTD and MoM fluctuations.


**Data Visualization Tools:**

1)Monthly Trends by Issue Date (Line Chart): Identifying seasonality and long-term trends in lending activities.

2)Loan Term Analysis (Donut Chart): Understanding the distribution of loans across various term lengths.

3)Employee Length Analysis (Bar Chart): Assessing lending metrics distribution among borrowers with different employment lengths.

4)Loan Purpose Breakdown (Bar Chart): Providing a visual breakdown of loan metrics based on stated purposes.

5)Home Ownership Analysis (Tree Map): Hierarchical view of how home ownership impacts loan applications and disbursements.

**Details Dashboard:**


The Details Dashboard will offer a consolidated view of key loan-related metrics and data points, providing users with efficient access to critical information about the loan portfolio, borrower profiles, and loan performance. It will serve as a one-stop solution for users seeking detailed insights into the lending operations of the organization.
